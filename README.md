# Brand Statement
🥳 🥳 🥳 🥳 🥳 🥳

I am a Web Developer with a keen eye for creating visually appealing and user friendly applications.  During Bootcamp, me and two team members developed a Cryptocurrency News Application using two API resources and the lesser utilized Bulma CSS Framework.  After receiving a Certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from UTSA Bootcamp, I’ve enjoyed working on the Front-End of applications--specifically with CSS and bringing the page to life with JavaScript functionality.  In the future, I see myself as a Full-Stack Developer leading a team that creates a variety of web applications.  I believe my background as a supervisor in the oilfield has prepared me for working with teams and exceeding client demand and expectations.

## Background & History
🎥 🎬 💻 🎥 🎬 💻

Following College I spent the first part of my career in the Health & Fitness industry as a trainer. I felt that even though Health & Fitness was a passion of mine, I wanted to try my hand in the Oil Field. I was hired on with Halliburton Energy Services from 2017-2020 in the Wireline Department. I went from a Shop hand to a Shop Supervisor and Assistant Local Explosives Safety Officer. I was laid-off in late 2020 due to downsizing in the industry.

Presently, as a 33 year old husband, father, and local resident of San Antonio, TX, I've began searching for a more stable, challenging, and growing industry to excel in. I've decided to go to school for computer programming at UTSA Bootcamps here in San Antonio. A career in programming offers a new world of possibilities and I look forward to showcasing the skills I'll learn in the next 6 months as well as bringing my strong team leadership and work ethic I've developed to the table.
